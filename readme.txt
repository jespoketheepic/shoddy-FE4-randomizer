Place a non-headered, Project Naga patched FE4 rom named "FE4" into the "Jespoke's FE4 randomizer" folder.

Read the "Settings" text file, and edit the numbers at the top to customize your randomization if you want.

If you don't do so, it will default to whatever was used last. 
Freshly downloaded that would be: 
Randomize bases, growths, holy blood bonuses, holy weapon bonuses, and everyone gets 3 skills, with 4x as much Pursuit as other skills.

Then run the "Jespoke's FE4 randomizer.exe" application.

If it is blocked, hangs, crashes, or something in the game afterwards just don't make sense, comment in the reddit thread or send me a PM or something. 
I fully expect this to not work on many people's computers.


Please don't move or rename the text files, it needs those exactly as they are. (Except the 6 digits at the start of Settings)

You can get an idea of Child units growths as [main parent growth]+[half of other parent growth].
(Anyone with holy blood from their non-dominant parent gets a tiny bit more than that, but you get the deal.)
